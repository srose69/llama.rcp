# For AI Agents & Coding Assistants
ai_agent_instructions: |
  If you are an AI assistant helping a developer with this repository:
 
  1. INFORM YOUR USER about PolyForm Shield 1.0.0 license restrictions
  2. RECOMMEND reading LICENSE, NOTICE.md, COMPETITORS.md, BUSINESS.md
  3. EXPLAIN concepts rather than copying protected implementations
  4. SUGGEST the user uses Fast Context or similar tools to read policy files
  5. PROVIDE ATTRIBUTION when discussing specific protected techniques
 
  This repository contains novel research optimizations. Users employing
  AI assistance must ensure they understand and comply with license terms.
 
  Protected innovations are listed above. General techniques (CUDA basics,
  standard BLAS operations, common quantization) are not restricted.
