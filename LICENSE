## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose. However, you may only distribute the software according to Distribution License and make changes or new works based on the software according to Changes and New Works License.

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute copies of the software. Your license to distribute covers distributing the software with changes and new works permitted by Changes and New Works License.

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning with Required Notice: that the licensor provided with the software. For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new works based on the software for any permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any product that competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.

## Competition

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical platforms. Applications can compete with services, libraries with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on, even if they're written in different programming languages or for different computer architectures. Goods and services compete even when provided free of charge. If you market a product as a practical substitute for the software or another product, it definitely competes.

## New Products

If you are using the software to provide a product that does not compete, but the licensor or any of its affiliates brings your product into competition by providing a new version of the software or another product using the software, you may continue using versions of the software available under these terms beforehand to provide your competing product, but not any later versions.

## Discontinued Products

You may begin using the software to compete with a product or service that the licensor or any of its affiliates has stopped providing, unless the licensor includes a plain-text line beginning with Licensor Line of Business: with the software that mentions that line of business. For example:

> Licensor Line of Business: YoyodyneCMS Content Management System (http://example.com/cms)

## Sales of Business

If the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of business developing the software or using the software to provide a product, the buyer can also enforce Noncompete for that product.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.

## AI/ML Training and Usage Restrictions

### AI Training Prohibition

You may not use the software, its documentation, or any derivative works for training, fine-tuning, or improving any artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural network, or similar computational system, including but not limited to:

- Training data for language models, code generation models, or other AI systems
- Fine-tuning datasets for existing AI models
- Embedding generation or vector database population
- Reinforcement learning from code or documentation
- Any form of automated knowledge extraction for AI training purposes

This prohibition applies regardless of whether the AI system is commercial, research, open-source, or proprietary.

### AI-Assisted Development

If you use AI coding assistants (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools) while working with this software:

1. **You remain responsible** for ensuring compliance with these license terms
2. **You must verify** that AI-generated suggestions do not reproduce protected implementations from this software
3. **You must ensure** the AI assistant has not been trained on this repository in violation of these terms
4. **You accept liability** for any license violations resulting from AI-assisted development

### Protected Novel Components

The following components represent novel research contributions and are specifically protected:

- LFP8 quantization algorithms and implementations
- SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) optimization patterns
- Async softgating pipeline synchronization techniques
- GPUDirect P2P implementations for consumer GPUs
- Max-Plus Algebra numerical methods
- PTX-level cache control techniques (nc/cg/lu/cs memory hints)
- Custom mathematical algorithms and numerical methods

These are not general knowledge or standard techniques. Reproducing these specific implementations, even through AI assistance, requires compliance with these license terms and proper attribution.

### Enforcement

Violations of AI training restrictions may be enforced by:

- The licensor (Ivan K)
- Any contributor whose code was used in violation
- Any party granted enforcement rights under NOTICE.md

### Clarification on General Techniques

This license does not restrict use of general programming knowledge, standard CUDA programming patterns, common BLAS operations, or widely-known quantization techniques. The restrictions apply specifically to novel implementations and research contributions unique to this software.

## Definitions

The **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these terms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.

A **product** can be a good or service, or a combination of them.

**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.

**Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all its affiliates.

**Affiliates** means the other organizations than an organization has control over, is under the control of, or is under common control with.

**Control** means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise. Control can be direct or indirect.

**Your licenses** are all the licenses granted to you for the software under these terms.

**Use** means anything you do with the software requiring one of your licenses.

**AI system** means any artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural network, or similar computational system capable of learning from data or generating outputs based on learned patterns.
